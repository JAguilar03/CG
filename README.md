# Computer Graphics Image Recreation OpenGL
Linux is required to run this program. 

This project is to recreate an handdrawn image that is a copy of an original image chosen that will be created in OpenGL
with primitives and simple properties. It will be expanded upon next project.

Since this is a cpp file, linux will require g++ 

To install, the command "sudo apt-get install g++" needs to be entered in the terminal

Along with this, glut will be used.

To install, the commands "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev" needs to be entered in the terminal

Once all is installed, type in "g++ -o CG ComputerGraphics.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut", this should compile the code

To execute, type in "./CG" 

The output should be an image of our original scene recreated in OpenGL
